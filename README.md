##The project should be running now.

I have realized many mistakes I did during the development of this project.
For example: I know that the functions should have been in the model but I put them in the controller for the time being. and that I haven't placed any checks for the inputs in the validation for example the max size of student name has to be max:20.

I realized that the tables of the migrations have 's' at the end of their names. e.g: model: Student => table: students.
So,kindly forgive my first attempt mistakes. I'm still learning.

Thank you for visiting the project.

### Stay Blessed!
